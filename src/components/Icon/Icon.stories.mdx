# Icons

## Source

We use icons from [Phosphor Icons](https://phosphoricons.com). Feel free to visit their site to see and search what's available.

To see their React implementation, please visit the [GitHub page](https://github.com/phosphor-icons/phosphor-react).

**While we implement a handful of icons here, you'll need to include the `phosphor-react` package in your respective project to use any outside the context of the UI Kit.**

## Defaults

There are defaults set on the icons via Phosphor React's `IconContext`.

The defaults are as follows:

```js
{
  color: 'currentColor', // `currentColor` is a special value that inherits from the parent element's color
  size: theme.fontSizes['70'], // Maps to 24px
  weight: 'regular',
  mirrored: false
}
```

## Usage

Please only use `theme.fontSizes[...]` and `theme.colors[...]` from `~/styles/stitches.config` when passing sizes and colors.

**Most of the time**, you likely won't need to change the styling via props. See [defaults](#defaults)

```jsx
import { Container } from '@flatironschool/ui'
import { FacebookLogo, YoutubeLogo } from 'phosphor-react'
import { theme } from '~/styles/stitches.config' // DO NOT use theme this way outside the Phosphor Icon context

const App = () => (
  <Container>
    <YoutubeLogo />
    <FacebookLogo color={theme.colors['black500']} size={theme.fontSizes['70']} />
  </Container>
)
```

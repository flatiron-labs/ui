# Container Component

The Container Component is used to wrap and layout all of the children components within the page.

Additionally, it does the following:

- Defines constistent global styles
- Instantiates `IconContext` with sensible defaults for later usage by `phosphor-react` icons.

## Usage

```jsx
import { Container } from '@flatironschool/ui'

const App = () => (
  <Container>
    <p>Children</p>
  </Container>
)
```
